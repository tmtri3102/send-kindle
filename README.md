# Kindle Sender

A simple command-line tool to convert a web page to a PDF and email it directly to your Kindle.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

This script requires the following tools to be installed on your macOS system:

- **Google Chrome** or **Brave Browser**
- **Homebrew**: The macOS package manager.
- **msmtp**: A lightweight SMTP client for sending emails from the command line.

If you don't have Homebrew and msmtp, run these one-shot commands:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install msmtp
```

---

## 2. Configuration

### 2.1. Configure Kindle Email

The first time you run the script, it will ask for your Kindle email. This is a one-time setup.

### 2.2. Configure msmtp

This tool uses a secure Google App Password to send emails. You must set this up before running the script.

1. Go to your [Google Account's App Passwords page](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
2. Select **Mail** for the app and **Other (Custom name)** for the device.
3. Name it `kindle_sender` and click **Generate**.
4. Copy the **16-character password**. You will not see it again.

Next, create the msmtp configuration file:

```bash
nano ~/.msmtprc
```

Paste the following content, replacing `<your_gmail_address>` with your Gmail address and `<your_app_password>` with the password you just copied:

```ini
# Gmail account
account default
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
from <your_gmail_address>
auth on
tls on
tls_certcheck off
user <your_gmail_address>
password <your_app_password>
```

Secure the configuration file:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.msmtprc
```

## 3. Installation

Run this single command to create the `sendkindle` script and make it executable. This is the most crucial step and is a single, complete command.

```bash
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/sendkindle >/dev/null <<'EOF'
#!/bin/zsh

USER_HOME="$HOME"
CONFIG_FILE="$USER_HOME/.kindle_sender_config"

if [[ ! -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]]; then
    echo "This is a one-time setup. Enter your Kindle email (example@kindle.com):"
    read -r KINDLE_EMAIL
    if [[ ! "$KINDLE_EMAIL" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@kindle.com$ ]]; then
        echo "Invalid Kindle email format."
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "KINDLE_EMAIL=$KINDLE_EMAIL" > "$CONFIG_FILE"
fi

source "$CONFIG_FILE"

if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
    echo "Usage: sendkindle <url>"
    exit 1
fi

URL="$1"
DESKTOP="$USER_HOME/Desktop"

FINAL_PDF_NAME="webpage_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)"
FINAL_PDF_PATH="$DESKTOP/$FINAL_PDF_NAME.pdf"

echo "Processing URL: $URL"
echo "Saving PDF to: $FINAL_PDF_PATH"

CHROME_BIN="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
BRAVE_BIN="/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser"
if [[ -f "$CHROME_BIN" ]]; then
    BROWSER_CMD="$CHROME_BIN"
elif [[ -f "$BRAVE_BIN" ]]; then
    BROWSER_CMD="$BRAVE_BIN"
else
    echo "Error: Chrome or Brave not found in /Applications."
    exit 1
fi

"$BROWSER_CMD" --headless --disable-gpu --print-to-pdf="$FINAL_PDF_PATH" "$URL"

if [[ ! -f "$FINAL_PDF_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "Error: PDF file could not be created."
    exit 1
fi

echo "PDF created successfully."

(
    echo "Subject: convert"
    echo "To: $KINDLE_EMAIL"
    echo "Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=frontier"
    echo ""
    echo "--frontier"
    echo "Content-Type: text/plain"
    echo ""
    echo "PDF converted from web page."
    echo ""
    echo "--frontier"
    echo "Content-Type: application/pdf"
    echo "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"$FINAL_PDF_NAME.pdf\""
    echo "Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64"
    echo ""
    base64 -i "$FINAL_PDF_PATH"
    echo "--frontier--"
) | msmtp -a default "$KINDLE_EMAIL"

echo "Email sent! PDF is on your Desktop."

EOF
```

After the command runs, make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sendkindle
hash -r
echo "The command 'sendkindle' is now ready to use."
echo "Usage: sendkindle <url>"
```

---

## 4. Usage

To run the script, simply call `sendkindle` with a URL as the argument.

```bash
sendkindle https://example.com
```

---

## 5. Expected Output

If the script runs successfully, you will see the following output in your Terminal:

```
Processing URL: https://example.com
Saving PDF to: ~/Desktop/webpage_20250821195929.pdf
PDF created successfully.
Email sent! PDF is on your Desktop.
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are the solutions based on common errors:

| Error                                            | Cause                                              | Solution                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `script error: Expected end of line`             | AppleScript syntax issues.                         | The current script uses msmtp to bypass this.                                        |
| `Operation timed out`                            | Network firewall blocking SMTP ports (587 or 465). | The msmtp setup with App Password bypasses this by using a more robust connection.   |
| `msmtp: unrecognized option '--file-attachment'` | Incorrect msmtp syntax.                            | The current script uses the corrected base64 method.                                 |
| `base64: invalid argument`                       | Incorrect base64 syntax.                           | The current script uses the corrected base64 -i syntax.                              |
| `unknown: fatal: unable to use my own hostname`  | Postfix is misconfigured.                          | The current script uses msmtp to bypass Postfix entirely.                            |
| `msmtp: authentication failed`                   | Incorrect App Password.                            | Generate a new App Password and update ~/.msmtprc.                                   |

## 7. Verification

Since the script reports success on the command line, the best way to verify the email was sent is to check your Gmail account.

- Go to your **Sent** folder in Gmail.
- You should see an email with the subject "convert" and the PDF attached.

This confirms the email has successfully left your computer. üëç
